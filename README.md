# RoleBot
RoleBot's current features include:

An event listener that triggers when a role change happens that will add or remove a role based on whether a user has two other required roles or not.
A /slash command to manually check all users (suitable for if the bot has downtime or for when it first joins)

# Important
Make sure to change all variables in the file RoleBot.py to their relevant values, including the TOKEN at the bottom.

# Setup

1) Install Python 3.7
2) pip install -U discord
3) pip install -U discord-py-slash-command
4) Navigate to the folder with RoleBot.py in it
5) Open a terminal
6) Run py .\RoleBot.py or python .\RoleBot.py

After a few seconds, to establish the connection, the bot will be active and can be used immediately. 

Other versions of Python should work and if you use a different version, remove the first line in the file.
