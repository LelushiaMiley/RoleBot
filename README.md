# RoleBot
A bot that will add/remove a role after a user acquires 2 roles or loses one.

To setup,

1) Install Python 3.7
2) pip install discord
3) pip install discord-py-slash-command
4) Navigate to the folder with RoleBot.py in it
5) Open a terminal
6) Run py .\RoleBot.py or python .\RoleBot.py

After a few seconds, to establish the connection, the bot will be active and can be used immediately. 

Other versions of Python should work and if you use a different version, remove the first line in the file.
