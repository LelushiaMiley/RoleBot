# RoleBot
A bot that will add/remove a role after a user acquires 2 roles or loses one or more.

IMPORTANT
Make sure to change all variables in the file RoleBot.py to their relevant values, including the TOKEN at the bottom.

To setup,

1) Install Python 3.7
2) pip install -U discord
3) pip install -U discord-py-slash-command
4) Navigate to the folder with RoleBot.py in it
5) Open a terminal
6) Run py .\RoleBot.py or python .\RoleBot.py

After a few seconds, to establish the connection, the bot will be active and can be used immediately. 

Other versions of Python should work and if you use a different version, remove the first line in the file.
